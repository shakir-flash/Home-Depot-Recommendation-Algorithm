## Project Overview

The Home Depot Recommendation Algorithm is designed to analyze customer behavior and product information to deliver tailored product recommendations. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system can suggest products that align with customer preferences, thereby improving user satisfaction and increasing sales.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- **Product Descriptions**: Detailed information about Home Depot products, including titles and descriptions.
- **Customer Interactions**: Historical data on customer searches, clicks, and purchases.

These datasets are essential for training and evaluating the recommendation models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shakir-flash/Home-Depot-Recommendation-Algorithm.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Home-Depot-Recommendation-Algorithm
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the recommendation system as follows:

1. **Prepare the data**: Ensure that the datasets are available in the `data/` directory. If not, download and place them accordingly.

2. **Run the recommender notebook**:

   Open the `recommender.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook recommender.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate recommendations.

## Methodology

The recommendation system employs a combination of NLP and machine learning techniques:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing product descriptions and customer interaction data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization to represent textual data numerically.
- **Model Training**: Implementing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to learn user preferences.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The system has demonstrated the ability to provide relevant product recommendations, enhancing the overall customer experience. Detailed results and performance metrics are documented within the `recommender.ipynb` notebook.
